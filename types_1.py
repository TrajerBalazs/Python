#We learned abotu data like numbers and strings. In programming terms, these values are called types

#Strings are characters between quotes " ", like the value "High".

sugar_content = "High"

#Integers represent whole numbers without decimal places like 42.

score = 42

#Float describe floating-point numbers with one or more decimal places after a point, like 3.14159

pi = 3.14159

#The type boolean represents only two values: the special values True and False. Store the value True inside this variable

recived_newsletter = True

#When storing False in is_on, we say that we assign a value to a variable.

is_on = False

#And this values like booleans, strings, and numbers called Types in python.
